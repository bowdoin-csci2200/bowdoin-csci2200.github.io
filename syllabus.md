# Algorithms, Spring 2024

## Syllabus


__Instructor:__ Laura Toma, email: ltoma at bowdoin.edu, office: Searles 219 

__Class time:__  MW  10:05-11:30, L1 Fri 10:05-11:30, L2 Fri 11:40-1:05

__Classroom:__  classes in Searles 223, labs in VAC North 304

**Prerequisites:** csci 2101 (Data Structures)


Algorithms are the backbone of computer science. Everywhere computer
sciences reaches, there is an algorithm.  This class is an
introduction to critical thinking and problem solving through the
design and analysis of algorithms.  Throughout the course we will
consider fundamental computational problems and their algorithmic
solutions. We'll illustrate the process of coming up with algorithms,
analysing their theoretical complexity, and arguing that they work
correctly. Overall we'll see that  the "...subject of
algorithms represents a powerful lens through which to view the field
of computer science in general" [Kleinberg & Tardos]


**Learning goals:** After taking this class you will be able to: 

  1. Demonstrate understanding of fundamental computational problems and the algorithms proposed to solve them
      1. Illustrate how these algorithms work
      2. Analyze their theoretical complexity 
      3. Use them as building blocks in other  algorithms 
  2. Demonstrate understanding of fundamental algorithmic design techniques (recursion, divide-and-conquer, greedy, dynamic programming)
  3. Demonstrate the ability to design efficient algorithms for _new_ problems 
      1. Come up with ideas
      2. Argue whether they are correct (justify correctness) or incorrect (come up with counter-examples)
      3. Analyze their theoretical complexity and compare them
      4. Consider the question: Can the solution be improved?

### Read the lecture notes

Each week, _before coming to class_, read the lecture notes so that
that you understand the big ideas and results ahead of the class.
This will make class time more effective and will allow more time for
questions and problems.

### The labs 

Every week we have a set of problems (the lab) focused on the topics
discussed that week. The lab problems are meant to be solved in class,
working with your group. Myself and the LAs will be around to work
with you, facilitate discussions and answer questions.

Labs are not graded and their goal is to help you learn.  It is
important that you strive to work through all problems, formulate
questions, check your notes, discuss with your group, the LAs and the
instructor, and get your questions answered. We will ocasionally go
over solutions to some lab problems as a class and if you find that
useful (or not) be sure to let me know how you feel so that we can
adjust.

Overall youâ€™ll probably find that most of your learning occurs in the
lab while working with your peers!


### Assignments

There will be 8-12 assignments this semester, roughly one assignment
per week, which  will be released in Gradescope. 

The assignments consist of _new_ problems for which you'll have to
come up with efficient solutions on your own. The assignments will
generally be hard and will provide opportunities to learn at a deeper
level, and will work towards the learning goal of "develop solutions
to new problems".

We expect everyone to do well on the homework, and to take the time to
write your work carefully. An important goal of the assignments is to
develop good algorithmic writing style --- your solutions need to look
professional, neat, easy to understand, explained, justified and
analyzed.


_Assignment partner policy:_ You may work with one partner (see course
policies for details on what this means).  One member of the team
should submit the assignment and should add the other member to the
"team" so that (s)he can get the credit.

_Assignment honor code:_ 
* Level 1: Assignments are at collaboration-level 1; that is,
verbal collaboration without solution sharing (check course policies
for details on what this means).  

*  Use the internet to learn, but don't cheat: There are lots of resources online, such as lecture notes, animations, visualizations, practice problems,
video recordings, which you are encouraged to explore to help you
understand the material. _However, you must be careful not to search
the internet (and that includes ChatGPT) for the homework  problems.  Searching for the
assignment problems on the internet violates academic honesty for this
class._




  
### Work and Grading Policy

- __Assignments: 40%__ 

- __Exams: 60%__ There will be 3 in-class exams: the first one in in
  week 6, the second one in week 10 and the last one at the end of the
  semester (check Polaris for the final exam slot for this class).
  The exams are non-cumulative, to the extent that it's possible. Each exam weighs 20%.
  
- __Class engagement:__ This means attending class, working with your
  group in the lab, asking questions, engaging in discussions,
  volunteering answers, participating on Slack, attending office hours
  and striving to turn in good work. Overall engagement will be used
  as a tie breaker when your score is between two grades.




### Time Commitment

This is a core CS class and will demand a significant time commitment
in order to achieve the learning goals. The actual time will vary from
week to week as some topics (esp towards the middle of the semester)
will be harder and may take more hours, and also based on your
background and interests.

Some of you will put in more or less time than suggested. That is
normal.  If you find that you struggle with discrete math
(e.g. logarithms, exponents, etc) you will need to allocate more time
to grasp those concepts --- hang in there, you just need more
practice. If you finish faster, use the time to work on the challenge
problems provided with each lab.


### What you can expect from me

My goal is to teach a class that's similar to algorithms classes at
peer institutions. The syllabus is packed and you will find the pace
and the problems ocasionally challenging. Many of the problems in labs
and assignments come from algorithms classes at other universities
(such as Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, etc).  Speaking of that, I am a big
fan of and grateful for open resources, and this is the reason I keep
this website on _github_ rather than behind Canvas.  Some of you will
go on to software engineering careers where a strong algorithmic
background is a must.  Many of you will go through technical
interviews which draw heavily from the content of this class. It is
important to pack many topics in the syllabus and expose you to
challenging new problems.  Ultimately the goal of the class is to give
you the tools so that you can solve new problems on your own.  A
strong algorithmic backgound will improve your analytical and
abstraction abilities and will be a big advantage to your career path,
whatever it might be.

My teaching style is to create a friendly, open atmosphere where
everyone feels comfortable and motivated to learn. There are no stupid
questions---any question is a sign that you want to engage. Based on
my experience, the most effective learning happens when YOU all work
well together.  Open collaboration in the lab is  highly
encouraged. All assignments are pair-optional, although everyone is highly
encouraged to find a partner.  To support everyone's learning at their
own pace I have created detailed lecture notes and an ample set of
supporting study questions, practice problems and quizzes. Please help
me make this class great by staying engaged and by giving me feedback
(even if I don't ask for it)! Feedback is always welcome.

I know there are circumstances in our lives that we can't control. If
you have any (significant) circumstances that make learning hard, just
talk to me, and we will figure something out.



### Tips

You will likely find this class to be difficult and very different
than 2101. The material is theoretical and spans many levels of
abstractions. Furthermore coming up with algorithms is both an art and a
science: there is no systematic way to have an idea, and problems that
seem very similar, may have very different solutions.


2101 vs 2200: Working on an algorithms assignment will seem easier than working on a programming assignment in Data Structures (remember debugging). 

* 2101: When you write code, the process of getting your code to work forces you to correct your logic until the program does what it's supposed to do.   

* 2200: When you write pseudocode for an algorithm, you have to rely on yourself to think through all its details carefully; you need to figure out if it has bugs without implementing it. __Thinking through your idea and all the cases that might happen --- it all happens in your head.__ There is no computer to tell you that you have bugs, that your logic has holes,  _YOU_ need to do that. In this class it will be easy to come up with algorithms that almost work .  The hard part will be coming up with an algorithm that is efficient and justifying that it is correct. That's the beauty of theory.


Here are some suggestions for doing well :

* Budget your time  and give yourself plenty of time to read the materials and work on the assignments each week. Take the labs seriously. Plan on at least 10 hours a week, and make a schedule which you follow every week. 

* Be pro-active about things that are not clear. There's a lot of
  helpful free resources out there. Just search on the Internet
  (really, that's ~~allowed~~ encouraged). BUT: don't search for the assignment problems (because that violates the honor code and  you won't learn anythingmuch). 

* Self-reflection: Try to formulate questions, and try to answer them yourself.

* Find a group of peers to work with. Explain your ideas, and listen
  to theirs. Try to argue why an idea is correct, or try to prove it
  wrong by finding an instance where it does not work.

* Go to the study groups and office hours and talk to myself and the
TAs; Listen to your peers' questions and get your questions answered.
Solve all problems that are assigned, even those that are optional.

* If you are Math-CS double major, you probably wish the class was
  more rigorous. Check out the lecture notes or a textbook for
  proofs. Many correctness justifications rely on induction, so if
  you've seen that, use this opportunity to come up with those proofs
  yourself (we'll skip them in class).

* Don't be harsh on yourself if you are not doing as well as you
  expected. It takes time to learn, and often we learn (more) from
  mistakes.
