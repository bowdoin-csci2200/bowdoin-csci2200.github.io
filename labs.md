## Labs 

The weekly labs complement the lectures and contain a set of exercises and problems which are meant to guide your learning. The labs are meant to be solved _in class_ throughout the week ---  we will set aside time to work on the lab problems during the regular class meetings and you will finish the lab during the designated lab period.  

**Lab Expectations:** The labs are there to help you learn, not to test you.  It is ok (and expected!) that you will have (lots of) questions.  We'll be around to talk to you.  As you work through the lab problems, work  with your group,  discuss your ideas, formulate questions and engage with the TAs and the instructor(s) to get your questions answered. It is important that you work thoroughly through all the problems, and that you are proactive when you don't understand something ---  we (the instructors and LAs) will be around to help. 

**Writing the labs:** Write down your solutions using your ipad and save it as a pdf document. The solutions can be quick/short but try to keep them moderately neat and make sure they are legible.  

**Submitting the labs:**   You need to submit every lab by the end of the lab period (for Fall 2024: by 2pm on Fridays), on Gradescope. The labs will be loosely graded (see rubric below) and returned to you by Mondays. The grade on the lab will give you quick feedback on how you are doing. 

**Lab grading rubric:**
* 0 points: lab is not submitted or work is not satisfactory (< 50%)
* 1 point:  lab work is in the B-C range (50%-75%). Solid work but needs to improve. 
* 2 points: lab work is in the A-B range (>75%). Good work. 

**Solutions:** We will ocasionally go over solutions to some lab problems as a class and if you find that useful (or not) be sure to let us know how you feel so that we can adjust.
