# Welcome to Algorithms, Spring 2024! 

This Github site hosts all **public** resources for the class
(syllabus, office hours, policies and detailed schedule).  In addition
we'll use:

* __Canvas__: The class has a _Canvas_ site, accessible through your
  Bowdoin portal, that hosts the **private** resources for this class
  (quizzes and the grade portal).

* __Gradescope__: We'll use Gradescope for the assignments. Gradescope
  helps streamline the process of submission, grading and returning
  feedback, and it is also useful for implementing practices like
  anonymous grading. Gradescope is now integrated with Canvas, and you
  can access it from Canvas (under Modules). You can also access it
  directly at _https://www.gradescope.com/_

* __Slack__: Class communication will be entirely on Slack. You will
  need to monitor Slack for class updates, including possible
  cancellations or delays.  The link to join Slack is the Canvas site.
