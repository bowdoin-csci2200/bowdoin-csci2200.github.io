This Github site (https://bowdoin-csci2200.github.io) hosts the general syllabus and policies for the class, as well as the detailed schedule and lecture notes. This site is public and you can access it anytime without your Bowdoin credentials. 

The __full resources__ for the class will be available on Canvas, Gradescope and Slack as follows: 

  * __Canvas:__ The Canvas site for the class hosts the quizzes.  (You'll also find there the link  to Gradescope and the url to join the Slack channel. ) 

  * __Gradescope__: You will use Gradescope for submitting your labs and assignments. We chose to use Gradescope because it helps streamline the process of submission, grading and returning  feedback, and it is also useful for implementing practices like anonymous grading. You can access Gradescope directly at [https://www.gradescope.com/](https://www.gradescope.com/); or, from this github site using the link in the upper corner; Or, from the Canvas site of this course. Note that you first need to enroll in this class in Gradescope. 

  * __Slack__: We will use Slack for all class comunication and announcements and sharing of resources.  Every week we will send a package with the package for the week (lectures notes, the lab, the assignment) and remind you of the upcoming deadlines. The LAs will send office hours reminders on Slack. Any class updates, including possible cancellations or delays, will also be posted on Slack.
