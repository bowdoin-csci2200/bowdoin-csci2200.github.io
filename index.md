# Welcome to Algorithms, Fall 2024! 

This Github site (https://bowdoin-csci2200.github.io) hosts the general syllabus and policies for the class, as well as the detailed schedule and lecture notes. This  will be your go-to site for the class. 

We will also use:   


* __Slack__: We will use Slack for all class comunication and announcements, including sharing of resources.  Every week we will send a package with the resources for the week (lectures notes, the lab, the assignment, etc) and remind you of the upcoming deadlines. The LAs will send office hours reminders on Slack. Any class updates, including possible cancellations or delays, will also be posted on Slack.   

* __Gradescope__: You will use Gradescope for submitting all your work (labs, quizzes and assignments). We chose to use Gradescope (rather than Canvas) because it helps streamline the process of submission, grading and returning  feedback, and it is also useful for implementing practices like anonymous grading. You can  access Gradescope directly at [https://www.gradescope.com/](https://www.gradescope.com/); or, from this github site using the link in the upper corner; Or, from the Canvas site of this course. Note that you first need to enroll in this class in Gradescope using the  code that I sent by email.

* __Canvas:__  The Canvas side for this class contains the url for this github site, the code to enroll in this class on Gradescope, and the url to join the Slack channel for this class. Note that if you bookmark this github site, you will likely _not_ need to access this class on Canvas.
