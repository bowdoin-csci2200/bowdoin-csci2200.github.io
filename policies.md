## Policies 

### Colaboration policy
Collaboration and discussion are crucial for this class. You will most likely find that you will gain a better
understanding of the material by discussing the problems with peers. Our goal is to ensure that the collaboration is appropriate and
effective, and that you become an independent problem solver capable to do work on your own. 
All students are expected to be familiar with and to comply with the department's [collaboration policy](https://turing.bowdoin.edu/dept/collab.php) and the four levels of collaboration it outlines. Specifically for this class,

  * **All in-class work and labs:** *collaboration-level 0*; that is, no restrictions.
  * **Assignments:**  *collaboration-level 1*; that is, verbal collaboration without solution sharing. You are
      allowed and encouraged to discuss ideas with other class members, but the communication should be verbal. No one is
      allowed to take notes during the discussion (being able to recreate the solution later from memory is proof that you
      actually understood it). Communication needs to stay at a high level and cannot include sharing pseudo-code for the problem.
  * **Exams:** *collaboration-level 3* (no collaboration  allowed, professor clarifications only).


### Assignment Internet policy
There are lots of resources online, such as lecture notes, animations, visualizations, practice problems, video recordings, which you are encouraged to explore if you feel you need additional resources to help you understand the material. __However, you must be careful not to search the internet or use generative AI (such as ChatGPT) for the specific problems in your quizzes, labs and assignments.  Doing so violates academic honesty for this class.__



### Assignment Partner Policy

All assignments are partner-optional, that is, you may work with **one** partner (teams of at most
2 people). You can have the same partner for all assignments, or you
can change partners. You and your partner(s) will work together on the
assignment throughout the whole process, you will write it and review
it together, and will submit one assignment. The assignment must be a
true joint effort, equally owned, created and understood by both
partners. Specifically splitting the assignment and working on the
problems separately is not allowed and violates the honor code for the
class.


### Assignment late policy 

Assignments will be posted with a **due date** and a **late due date** which will usually be 3 days after the due date (exceptions will be made to accomodate exams, breaks, last day of classes, etc).  Assignments submitted past the  due date will be marked LATE by Gradescope and will incur a penalty of .4% per hour (9.6% per day), which will be automatically applied at the end of the semester. Assignment submission will close after the assignment's late due date, and you will not be able to submit the assignment after that.  


<!---
Most topics build directly on prior topics, so it is critical not to fall behind!

#### Flex days 
#To provide some flexibility  you are allotted __three flex days__ for
#the semester, each of which may be used to submit an assignment or a
#quiz up to 24 hours late (up to 72 hours late if all three flex days
#are applied all at once). For a team assignment, applying a flex day
#uses a flex day from each group memberâ€™s allotment. If you want to use
#a Flex day please message me on Slack clearly stating which flex days
#you want use and for which assignment/quiz (for e.g. "I would like to
#use 1st flex day for assignment 4").  

#Since Canvas does not implement Flex days at the moment, at the end of
#the semester I will go through your assignments and quizzes and I will
#waive three late penalties (corresponding to three flex days).

### Labs late policy 

Labs are meant to be completed in class and have to be turned by their due date as it appears in Gradescope. __Labs are not accepted after the due date.__ Once the submission deadline closes Gradescope will not accept your lab.  It is better to turn in an unfinished lab than not to turn in at all. 

### Quizzes late policy 

Quizzes have to be turned by their due date as it appears in Gradescope. __Quizzes are not accepted after the due date.__  Once the due date passes the submission will close and you will not be able to take the quiz. 


### Emergencies 

Please familiarize yourself with the late policies of this course so that you can plan your time accordingly. Most weeks you will have three deadlines (lab, quix, assignment). _This structure has been put in place to help you._ If you attend the lectures and engage in the class work, you will have no problem completing the lab and quizzes by the deadline. 

Please note that late assignments are accepted with a small and fair hourly penalty as stated above. You do not need to email us asking  permission to submit an assignment late. Gradescope will accept your assignment until its posted _late due date_. 

Exceptions to the late policy will be made in case of significant circumstances (such as you are sick, concussion, family situations, etc). __If such a situation arises please let your instructor know as soon as possible and we will make a plan together.__ Note that the circumstances have to be _significant_ (for e.g. taking two classes with homework deadlines the same day, or traveling for athletics events or hackathons, do not count as an emergency).  


### Regrades

You can submit a regrade request within 7 days of receiving your
grade. You should do this only if you believe there is a grading
error, not simply because you want a higher grade.  If the assignment
was handled via Gradescope, you can submit the Regrade request on
Gradescope. Otherwise, send me a message on Slack.
