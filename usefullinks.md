## Other resources and useful links 


__Textbook:__ The class is based on the following textbook: Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, McGraw Hill, New York. The book is not required. It is available online, and there are copies in Searles 224. 

If you want to dive deeper into proofs and the mathematics of computer science, here are two good (and free) resources: 

- [Building blocks for theoretical computer science](http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/building-blocks/) by Margaret Fleck
- [Mathematics for Computer science](http://opendatastructures.org/LLM.pdf)by Lehman, Leighton and Meyer


Below is a list of resources  (by no means exhaustive) which I highly recommend.
